## The Course of WWII in Europe and the Pacific

**1933**

- Hitler startds to violate the terms of the Treaty of Vesailles by
	- Increasing the size of the military
	- reintroducing conscription
	- re-establishing the air force and
	- increased weapons and ammo.
- Hitler's aim was to retake territory for Germany to go back to its original state. Furthermore he wanted the Aryan race to have a lot of room to flourish.

- The British and French tolerated these incidents - this was known as a policy of appeasement because:
	- They thought they'd avoid war
	- Neither country could afford war due to the Great Depression
	- Treaty was believed to be too harsh and so Hitler was justified

**Policy of Appeasement**
*This cartoon illustrated at the time criticize the Allies (in particular were letting Hitler literally "walk all over them" and paving the way for Hitler to become "Boss of the Universe")*

**1938**

 12 March - Hitler annexed (took over control of) Austria
					Britain and France did not react

September - Hitler demanded parts of Czechosovakia be returned to Germany.
					Britain, France and Italy agreed to return it to Germany as long as Hitler didn't try to claim any more territory.

9 - 10 November - Kristallnacht - "Night of Broken Glass"
					Wave of violence directed against Jewish synagogues, businesses and houses.
					Clearly organised by the Nazis, however Hitler claimed it was the German people due to their anti-Jewish sentiments.

                          declare war on Germany.

30 September - Germany's advance on Poland was extremely fast using a swift, focused 
                            war offensive called Blitzkrieg. Poland was divided between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
