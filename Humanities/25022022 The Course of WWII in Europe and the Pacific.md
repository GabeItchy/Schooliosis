## The Course of WWII in Europe and the Pacific

**1933**

- Hitler startds to violate the terms of the Treaty of Vesailles by
	- Increasing the size of the military
	- reintroducing conscription
	- re-establishing the air force and
	- increased weapons and ammo.
- Hitler's aim was to retake territory for Germany to go back to its original state. Furthermore he wanted the Aryan race to have a lot of room to flourish.

- The British and French tolerated these incidents - this was known as a policy of appeasement because:
	- They thought they'd avoid war
	- Neither country could afford war due to the Great Depression
	- Treaty was believed to be too harsh and so Hitler was justified
