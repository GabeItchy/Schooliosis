Groups of Indigenous Australians protested 'Australia Day' by gathering to march from the Sydney Town Hall for the 'Day of Mourning and Protest.' They were refused permission to meet at the Town Hall but instead marched to Australian Hall where they weere forced to enter through the back.

A manifesto called *Aborigines Claim Citizen Rights* was distributed at the meeting. The opening of the manifesto stated:
