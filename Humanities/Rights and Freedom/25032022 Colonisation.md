## Colonisation and Dispossesion


**British colonisation of Australia

British explorers and settlers arrived on the east coast of Australia in 1788. The British looked for signs of permanent residence and evidence of farming but claimed to find none. This led them to proclaim Australia terra nullius - A latin term that literally translate to "nobody's land".

Evidence has since surfaced that challenges the claims of no residence or farming practices. The Indigenous people had craticised the idea of permanent residency and farming as justification of stealing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
