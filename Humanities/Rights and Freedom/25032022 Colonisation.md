## Colonisation and Dispossession


**British colonisation of Australia

British explorers and settlers arrived on the east coast of Australia in 1788. The British looked for signs of permanent residence and evidence of farming but claimed to find none. This led them to proclaim Australia terra nullius - A latin term that literally translate to "nobody's land".

Evidence has since surfaced that challenges the claims of no residence or farming practices. The Indigenous people had craticised the idea of permanent residency and farming as justification of stealing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

**Eras of Colonisation**

*Dispossession*

The first arrival of British led to the frontier wars, forcible removal of the Indigenous peoples from their land and many massacres. Many of the First People were moved onto reserves.

*The Frontier Wars*

A series of conflicts adn events that began in 1788 and lasted until the 1930s. First Nations people were involved in conflicts and battles to defend their country and Europeans carried out massacres to expand the British colony.

First Nations people adapted quickly, often employing guerilla warfare tactics - fast moving, small scale actions including ambushes, sabotage and raids.

*Protectionism*

Removing children from families (Stolen Genrations) "for their own good" in order to begin a process of trying to assimilate "half-caste" Indigenous children into British-Australian society.
