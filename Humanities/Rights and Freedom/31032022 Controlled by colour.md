## Controller by Colour

The 'assimilation policy' was officially adopted in 1937.

Aborginal and Torres Strait Islander people of mixed race were to be assimilated into White society whether they wanted to be or not. This was a new form of control.

## Segregation

Another effective means of controlling Aboriginal people was to prevent them from fully participating in white society.

'Colour Bars' - Bans that prevented Aboriginal people from entering clubs, pubs, restaurants, theatres, public swimming pools or using public transport - resulted in a form of apartheid

**Apartheid** - A policy or system of segregation or discrimination on grounds of race.
