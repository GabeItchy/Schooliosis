## Introduction To Genetics

**Genetics**

*Is the study of genes*

**DNA**

*All living organism have DNA and it is passed down from generation. DNA contains information about different species.*

## Gregor Mendel

*Gregor mendel was an Austrian monk and scientist
*He is known as the 'father of genetics

*Before him inheritance wa sthought as mixture of features that could not be separated

*He observed the sparation of characteristic in pea plants

**The Principle of Segregation

Traits or characteristics of living things exist in pairs of factors. These factors must seperate before they can be passed on to the offspring. Every organism inherits one set from their mother and one set from their father.

**The Principle of Independent Assortment

Each trait is inherited independently from other factors. just because you inherite one factor (eg. Blue Eyes) from your mother, does not mean you inherit all other factors from her (eg. Her blonde hair and small nose.)

## James Watson and Francis Crick

In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick worked as a team to find the structure of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). It was indentified as a double helix (two strands).

They were both given a nobel prize for work on the structure of DNA.

## Rosalind Franklin

Wilkins showed Watson an X-ray image of Franklin's DNA she discovered. Rosalind Franklin had images of the structure of DNA, but her contribution to science was not recognised until after her death.

## Charles Darwin

Charles Darwin was a British biologist who played a major role in the 'Theory of evolution'.
His studies of various plants led him to publish his own book where he detailed all of his theories in.
