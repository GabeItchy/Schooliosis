## Your DNA Blueprint

- DNA is the chemical that makes up our genes
- It is like a blueprint for every structure and function in an organism
- It contains a code unique to the individual that can be passed to offspring
- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is found in the nucleus

## Structure of A Nucleotide

- Each DNA strand is like a necklace of beads. The individual 'beads' are called *nucleotide*

A nucleotide is the building block of DNA. It is composed of three parts:

- A nitrogen base (also called a base)
- A sugar molecule (deoxyribose)
- A phosphate molecule

In DNA there are four types of nitrogen base:
(A) Adenine
(T) Thymine
(G) Guanine
(C) Cytosine

**Double Helix**

The four different types of nitrogen bases ALWAYS link in a specific way:

Adenine with Thymine
Cytosine with Guanine

These pairings are called complementary bases.

When nucleotides join together, they form a long chain called a nucleic acid. DNA is a nucleic acid.

Nucleotides are joined together by their sugar and phosphate groups.

These nitrogen bases are bounded together by hydrogen bonds (weak bonds), between the bases.

## Structure of DNA


The two strands do not run straight along each other, but rather they twist around each other forming what is called a double helix.

- DNA has two very important properties:
- DNA can make copies of itself: the two strands unwind, separate and each strand can be copied to make a new molecule
- DNA carries information: the order in which the bases are arranged codes for specific proteins.
