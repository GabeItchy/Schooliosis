## Your DNA Blueprint

- DNA is the chemical that makes up our genes
- It is like a blueprint for every structure and function in an organism
- It contains a code unique to the individual that can be passed to offspring
- DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is found in the nucleus

## Structure of A Nucleotide

- Each DNA strand is like a necklace of beads. The individual 'beads' are called *nucleotide*

A nucleotide is the building block of DNA. It is composed of three parts:

- A nitrogen base (also called a base)
- A sugar molecule (deoxyribose)
- A phosphate molecule
