# DNA

- **Genes** - Is a section of DNA that determines a trait (e.g. Hair colour or eye colour). They are found on chromosomes.
- **Chromosomes** - Long strings of DNA tightly wound around proteins. They are found in the nucleus of every cell.


# Relationships between DNA, Chromosomes and Genes
*There are 46 Chromosomes in a human nucleus (23 from the mother and 23 from the father)**

*Male has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while a Female just has two X chromosome.*

*Chromosomes can be made up of one individual strand or two strands shaped like an 'X'
The two strands are made up of indentical DNA.*

**Homologous** - A pair of matching chromosomes.
**Karyotype** - A picture of all the homologous chromosomes in a cell.
**Chromatid** - Each strand of a chromosome

# 2.3 Check Your Learning

**1. Identify the number of chromosomes in each of your cells**
	There are 46 Chromosomes in each of your cells
**2. Define the term 'karyotyping'**
	Taking photos of the homologous chromosomes in a cell
**3. Describe how DNA is like a string of beads**
	The proteins is the beads and the DNA would be the string
**4. Identify the names of the nitrogen bases that are represented by the letter A,T,G and C.**
	Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine
**5. Identify the nitrogen bases that are complementary to A,T,G and C**
	A -> T
	G -> C
	T -> A
	C -> G
**6. Compare (the similarities and differences between) DNA, chromosomes and genes.**
They are all within a nucleus cell. Genes are in the DNA and DNA are within the chromosome.
