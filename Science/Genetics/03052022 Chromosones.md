# DNA

- **Genes** - Is a section of DNA that determines a trait (e.g. Hair colour or eye colour). They are found on chromosomes.
- **Chromosomes** - Long strings of DNA tightly wound around proteins. They are found in the nucleus of every cell.


# Relationships between DNA, Chromosomes and Genes
*There are 46 Chromosomes in a human nucleus (23 from the mother and 23 from the father)**

*Male has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while a Female just has two X chromosome.*

*Chromosomes can be made up of one individual strand or two strands shaped like an 'X'
The two strands are made up of indentical DNA.*
**Homologous** - A pair of matching chromosomes.
**Karyotype** - A picture of all the homologous chromosomes in a cell.
