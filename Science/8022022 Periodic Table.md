## Periodic Table

- Because of the continuos discoveries of the new elements, the periodic table is constantly been refined multiple times over the years.


// Ancient Greeks 100 AD 
- The first periodic table would've consisted of elements of earth, wind, fire and air. 

// 1661 Robert Boyle
- Robert Boyle suggested that an elemenet is a substance that cannot be broken down.

// 1789 Antoine Lavoiser
- Made a list of 33 elements. He began grouping the elements in Metals and Non-metals

// 1820 Jakob Berzelius
- Used abbreviations for the chemicals symbols and set hydrogen's weight to 1

// 1829 Johann Dobereiner
- Johann discovered that groups of three elements showed similar properties and labelled them in 'triads'

// 1864 John Newlands
- Arranged the elements by weight. Newlands compared the elements to music octaves as they repeated properites every 8 elements.

// 1869 Dmitri Mendeleev
- Arranged the elements by weight then in groups of similar properties. He also discovered gaps for undiscovered elements.

// 1894 Willian Ramsay
- Discovered the Noble Gases. (Argon, Neon, Helium, etc)

// 1911 Marie Curie
- Indentified and purified new elements with radiation. Won two Nobel Prizes for her work on radiation.

// 1913 Henry Moseley
- Used x-rays to determine atomic number. Ordered elements by atomic number instead of weight.

// 1940 Glen Seaborg
- Used neutrons with Uranium to make heavier atoms such as plutonium. Elements can now be created because of him.
