## Periodic Table

- Because of the continuos discoveries of the new elements, the periodic table is constantly been refined multiple times over the years.


// Ancient Greeks 100 AD 
- The first periodic table would've consisted of elements of earth, wind, fire and air. 

// 1661 Robert Boyle
- Robert Boyle suggested that an elemenet is a substance that cannot be broken down.

// 1789 Antoine Lavoiser
- Made a list of 33 elements. He began grouping the elements in Metals and Non-metals

// 1820 Jakob Berzelius
- Used abbreviations for the chemicals symbols and set hydrogen's weight to 1

// 1829 Johann Dobereiner
- Johann discovered that groups of three elements showed similar properties and labelled them in 'triads'

// 1864 John Newlands
- Arranged the elements by weight. Newlands compared the elements to music octaves as they repeated properites every 8 elements.

// 1869 Dmitri Mendeleev
- Arranged the elements by weight then in groups of similar properties. He also discovered gaps for undiscovered elements.

// 1894 Willian Ramsay
- Discovered the Noble Gases. (Argon, Neon, Helium, etc)

// 1911 Marie Curie
- Indentified and purified new elements with radiation. Won two Nobel Prizes for her work on radiation.

// 1913 Henry Moseley
- Used x-rays to determine atomic number. Ordered elements by atomic number instead of weight.

// 1940 Glen Seaborg
- Used neutrons with Uranium to make heavier atoms such as plutonium. Elements can now be created because of him.

There are 118 different elements on the Periodic Table in increasing atomic number
Elements are pure substances that are made up of only one type of atom. They're the bulding blocks from which all other substances are made.

## 4.1 Develop your abilities 

1. Evaluate the effectiveness of two alternative versions of the periodic tables.
	- In Figure 9, we can tell that there is a huge abundancy of hydrogen because it is bigger than other elements and is color coded green indicating that there is plenty of it.
	- In Figure 10, the elements are arranged in a spiral pattern going from the lowest atomic number and spiralling outwards. They are also divided in colors. What we can tell by hydrogen is that it is 1 in the atomic number and is different from the others.
	- You can find out the atomic number, the neutrons, mass and abbreviation of the element of hydrogen.
	- You are able to identify and find elements easier on the modern one, while the others require you to have prior knowledge.
	- The modern one.
