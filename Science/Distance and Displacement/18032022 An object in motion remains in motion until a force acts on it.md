## An Object in motion remains in motion until a force acts on it

**Who was Isaac Newton**

*Isaacs Newton was an English Scientist. He was one of th efirst people to obeserve and study the effects of gravity. Newton formulated the three laws of motions, which are still relevant and used today.*

**Newton's first law**

*Newton's First Law / Law of Inertia - **An object remains at rest or in constant motion in a straight line unless acted on by a net unbalanced force.***

*Inertia - **The tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion while either at rest or in constant motion. The greater the mass of an object, the larger the inertia.***

A pebble would have less inertia than a boulder.

## Law of Inertia

*In order for an object to overcome its inertia, force has to be applied. Force is measured in Newtons. A force always happens between two objects, ie. one object will push or pull another. Force is what either starts or stops movement, or changes the direction of an object. A stationary object, such as someone sitting on a chair, has the force of gravity acting on it and a force pushing up on the object from the surface.
If the two forces are equal in strength (Balanced) we say the object has zero net force.*

***Net Force*** - *The sum of all the forces acting on an object, also known as resultant force.*
