## Newton's third law
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction on another object.

*The reaction force is the force that acts in the opposite direction of the action force.*

The magnitude of the action force and reaction force are the same, the direction is opposite, because the action force and reaction force are acting on **different** objects, they are NOT balanced and therefore cannot cancel each other.
