## Newton's Second Law

**Newton's Second Law

*Newton's Second Law - The acceleration of an object is directly related to the magnitude (strength) and direction of the force acting on the object*

Newton (N) is the unit of Force

Newton's Second law can be summarized with this equation:

*Force = Mass * Acceleration 
$$
F =ma
$$

Mass = Force / Acceleration
$$
M = {\frac{F}{A}}
$$
Acceleration = Mass / Force
$$
A = {\frac{M}{F}}
$$
**Force Affects Acceleration

*When the net force is in the opposite direction, the moving object will slow down and ecentually stop.*

## Mass vs Weight

*Mass: how much matter an object contains. Mass is not a force
Weight: The force from gravity acting on an object. Weight is a force.*

*Weight can be calculated with the following formula:


Gravity on Earth = 9.81m/s^2

Weight = Mass * Gravitational acceleration
$$
W = M*G
$$
Mass = Weight / Gravitational acceleration
$$
M={\frac{W}{G}}
$$
Gravitational Acceleration = Weight / Mass
$$
G = {\frac{W}{M}}
$$

1. Define the term 'weight force'

	*The force from gravity acting on an object.*
	
2. What happens to a moving object if it is acted on by a net force in the same direction as its motion

	*The moving object will keep on moving*

3. Describe what happens to a moving object if it is acted on by a net force in the opposite direction to its motion.

	*The moving object's force is cancelled out and the object stops moving.*

4. Compare the acceleration of a bus full of passangers to that of an empty bus, if the same net force is used.

	*Though the difference is really unoticable, a bus full of passangers will require more force to accelerate than an empty bus.*

5. Explain why a bike slows down on a level road when the rider stops pedalling

	Because of the net force acting upon the biker or bike is pushing in the opposite direction, they will slow down then they stop pedalling

6. A net force causes a mass of 10kg to accelerate at 2m/s^2. Calculate the magnitude of the net force.

	2 x 10 = 20
	The Magnitude of the net force is 20N
