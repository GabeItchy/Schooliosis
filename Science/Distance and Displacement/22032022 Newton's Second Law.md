## Newton's Second Law

**Newton's Second Law

*Newton's Second Law - The acceleration of an object is directly related to the magnitude (strength) and direction of the force acting on the object*

Newton (N) is the unit of Force

Newton's Second law can be summarized with this equation:

*Force = Mass * Acceleration 
$$
F =ma
$$

Mass = Force / Acceleration
$$
M = {\frac{F}{A}}
$$
Acceleration = Mass / Force
$$
A = {\frac{M}{F}}
$$
**Force Affects Acceleration

*When the net force is in the opposite direction, the moving object will slow down and ecentually stop.*

## Mass vs Weight

*Mass: how much matter an object contains. Mass is not a force
Weight: The force from gravity acting on an object. Weight is a force.*

*Weight can be calculated with the following formula:


Gravity on Earth = 9.81m/s^2

Weight = Mass * Gravitational acceleration
$$
W = M*G
$$
Mass = Weight / Gravitational acceleration
$$
M={\frac{W}{G}}
$$
Gravitational Acceleration = Weight / Mass
$$
G = {\frac{W}{M}}
$$
