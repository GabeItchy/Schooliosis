## Velocity is Speed With Direction

L.i. To understand the difference between velocity and speed
S.c. To Calculate the velocity and speed

**Speed**

*Speed is a measure of how fast a person or object is travelling in a set time. It is measured in metres per second (m/s or ms)

Hence, a speed of 5m/s means the object is traveling 5 metres per second of its motion
Speed is a scalar quantity because it only has size and no direction.*

**Calculating Speed**

*To calculate the average speed, divide the total distance travelled by the total time taken.
The Formula for calculating the average speed is. 



## The Average Speed Triangle


***Average Speed(s)= Total distance travelled (d)/Total time taken to travel(t).***

$$
S = {\frac{D}{T}}
$$
**Average Time = D/S
$$
T = {\frac{D}{S}}
$$

**Average Distance = S * T
$$
D={S * T}
$$

**Velocity**

*Velocity is a measure of how fast a moving object is travelling in a particular direction (m/s)
The Direction of the average velocity is the same as the direction of the displacement
Velocity is a vector quantity because it has size and direction
*
## The Velocity Triangle

**Average Velocity (V) = Total Displacement(D)/ Time(T)
$$
V={\frac{D}{T}}
$$
Average Time = Displacement / Velocity
$$
T= \frac{D}{V}
$$
Displacement = Time * Velocity**
$$
D= T * V
$$
**Acceleration = Velocity / Time
$$
A={\frac{V}{T}}
$$
## Speed Time Graph

*In a speed-time graph, speed is on the y axis, time on the x axis

If the graph is sloping upwards, the velocity is increasing. If the graph is sloping downwards, the velocity is decreasing. *

**To find displacement from a graph, you find the area of the shape**  

 **Acceleration**

 Acceleration is the rate at which the speed of an object changes. This is measured in m/s^2 or km/h^1

 If an object travels at a aconstand speed, the acceleration is zero

 **Deceleration**

Deceleration is the rate at which the speed slows down (negative acceleration)

**Calculating Acceleration**

To calculate the acceleeration, divide the change in speed by the change in time.

The formula for calculating the acceleration is 

The v is the 'final speed'
The u is the 'starting speed'

The Î” means 'a change in'
