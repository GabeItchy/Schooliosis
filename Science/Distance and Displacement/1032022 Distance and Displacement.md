## Distance and Displacement

**Distance:** Is how far an object travels over a period of time.
**Displacement:** describe the change in position of an object (starting position to end position) and its direction over a period of time

*Displacement DOES NOT include the in-between movements.*


Distance only has size, or magnitude but no direction: SCALAR QUANTITY

Displacement has size and direction: VECTOR QUANTITY 
(*If a diagram has an arrow its a vector quantity*)

**Position Time Graph**

A position time graph is a visual representation of a movement.

**Distance and Displacement Diagrams**

The distance an object travels can also be represented by diagrams.
North commonly point towards the top of the page
Only useful if the motion happens on the same line

E.g: Show a diagram of a person walking 5 meters north, then 4 metres west, then 2 metres south and 4 metres east.

Most useful when movement changes from linear to two dimensions

1. **Describe a motion that has zero displacement**
	*A motion that has zero displacement is when you end up back to where you started by the end of your travel/day/movement*
2. **Compare displacement and distance**
	Distance is how far an object travels but the displacement is the difference between the starting position and the finishing position.
3. **An object moves 14 m north and then 14 m south. Calculate the distance that it has covered. Calculate its displacement**
	The distance covered is 28m but the displacement is zero because you end up back where you started.
4. **Compare a vector quantity and a scalar quantity**
	A scalar quantity has size and/or magnitude
	A vector quantity has size and direction
5. **A person runs 50m north, then 20m south and then 30m west. Calculate the total distance covered, Calculate the person's displacement.**
	The total distance covered is 100m
	The person displacement is 60m

	6. **A car starts from rest and move snorth at a constant rate for 400m, then stops for 100s before moving north another 150m. Make a graph.

	7. **Consider the graph in Figure 4.**

	a. **Describe the motion shown.**
		The object, though it is not shown on the graph, they travels 20m prior to recording their distance. They stopped for 8 seconds on 20m before moving 20m South for 4 seconds

	b. **Calculate the distance covered in the graph**
		They covered 40m
	c. **Calculate the displacement shown**
		-20m
