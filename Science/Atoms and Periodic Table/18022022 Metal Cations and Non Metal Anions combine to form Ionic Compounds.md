## Ions

*Atoms are generally neutral. This means the negative and positive charge are the same.
Protons = electrons
However if electrons are lost or gained there will be the same number of protons and electrons. The atom becomes charged (negatively charged.)*

- When an atom gains or loses electrons (a charged atom). The process is called ionisation

Gain Electron - Negative
Lose Electron - Positive

**Forning Ions**

Electrons shells are most stable when they are full (8 valence electrons). Sometimes two or more atoms may share electrons to achieve balance (full electron shell).

The number of protons does nto change, even when electrons move.

**Ionisation

- When ionisation occurs, the ion has a full outer shell of electrons.

**Anion (Negative Ion)

- A negatively charged ion (more electrons than protons.) Mostly non-metals.

**Cation (Postive Ion)

- A positively charged ion (more protons than electrons.) Mostly metals.

**Ionic Bonds

- Ionic Bonds are very hard to break and ionic compounds are hard to melt.

**Polyatomic ions

- Many ions are made of two or more atoms. They are called polyatomic ions.
