 ## Non-Metals have properties in common

**Metalloids**
*Metalloids are the small set of elements along the 'staircase' diagonal boundary between the metals and non-metals*

- Metalloids exhibit properties between metals and non-metals
- Metalloids conduct electricity, but only under certain conditions.
- Semiconductors are elements that only conduct electricity under certain conditoins. (Boron, Silicon & Germanium)

**Non-Metals**
*Non-metals are dull, not ductible, have a larger range of melting and boiling points and at room temperature most of them are gases.*

## Group 17 - The Halogens
- The elements found in group 17 are called halogens
- Their atoms all have 7 electrons in their outer shell
- **The further down you go, the less reactive the elements shall be (unlike metals)
- Halogens are used for cleaning as they are good for sterilising and killing bacteria & funji.

## Group 18 - The Noble Gases
- The noble gases, such as neon and argon are found in group 18
- The noble gases have 8 electrons in their outer shell (except helium that has 2)
- They are all gases at room temperature a5nd are very unreactive.
