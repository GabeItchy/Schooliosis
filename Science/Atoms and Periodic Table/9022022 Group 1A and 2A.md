## Group 1 and 2

*Li. To learn about metals
Sc. To explain some of the characteristics of the first two groups of the periodic table*

**Elements

- There are three main types of elements: metals, non-metals & metalloids- Metals are defined by their lustrous appearance and their ability to conduct heat.

**Metals

Metals have many properties in common:
- Lustrous 
- Able to conduct heat and electricity
- Malleable
- Ducticle

**Group 1 - Metals

The alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium, are found in group 1
*Properties of Group 1*

- One electron in their outer shell
- Low melting points
- Soft
- Very reactive to water
- The reaction with water is more violent as you move down the group
- In their pure state, they often resemble plasticine that, if cut, is very briefly shiny silver before reacting with the air to become white again.

**Group 2 - Metals

The alkaline earth metals, such as magnesium and calcium are found in group 2:
- Two Electrons in their outer shell
- low melting point
- Soft (but harder than alkali metals)
- Highly reactive

**Transition Metals

- The transitional metals are found in a large block of the periodic table.
- Many of these metals have unique properites that aren't shown by group 1 or 2 metals.

*Properties of Transitional Metals*
- A small number are magnetic
- Silvery in color (except gold and copper)
- Many form coloured compounds, such as gemstones
