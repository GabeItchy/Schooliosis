## Composition of an Atom

*Nucleus has protons and neutrons (Creates atomic mass)
Shell has electrons*

- Protons are postive charge
- Neutrons are uncharged
- Electron has a negative charge

## The Bohr Model

- Electrons have a negative charge and they spin around the nucleus
- When describing atoms we use the Bohr model, which shows electrons arranged in shells, or energy level, around the nucleus.

**Shells

- Each shell has a set amount of electrons it can hold.
- When the maximum number is reached. We move up to the next shell
- This arrangement is called electron configuration

| Shell     | Max Number of Electrons |
| --------- |:-----------------------:|
| 1st Shell |       2 Electrons       |
| 2nd Shell |       8 Electrons       |
| 3rd Shell |       8 Electrons       |
| 4th Shell |      18 Electrons       |


## Structure of an Atom

- The no. of electrons in each shell increases as we move away from the nucleus
- The outermost electron shell is called the **valence shell** 

**Valence Shells

Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in the valence shell (outermost Shell).

*The period show the number of electron shells*

The Electrons in the valence shells determine chemical bonds


## Emission spectrum

When heat is applied, electrons become 'excited' gain energy and move from an inner shell to an outer one (away from the nucleus)
