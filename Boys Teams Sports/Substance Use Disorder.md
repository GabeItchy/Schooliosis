## Substance Use Disorder

**Definition:** *Substance Use Disorder is a mental health problem that affects a person's brain and behaviour. This causes the person to be unable to control their use for legal and illegal drugs or medication. Sometimes a person who has this disease won't be able to function normally in society if they don't have their dose. A person with this disease will increase their dosage just to get a high. Furthermore this type of person will go out of their way to buy this drug even if they don't have money for it.*

**Triggers:** *Similar to many mental health problems, many causes of drug addictions can be the environment that you live in, furthermore this includes the exposure to a certain peer groups that encourage the use of drug. (This type of group seems to play a role in the beginning of drug use.)

Once the use of drug was begun, the development leading to addiction can be influence by genetic traits which can slow down or speed up the progression of the problem.

**Impacts (Social):** *The first impacts that can happen are phsyical changes to the face, body or limbs but they can also happen internally with rotting organs or it can cause damage to neurons in the brain. These changes can linger long after you recover from drug addiction. Once deep into this addiction, the person may exhibit intense urges for the drug that can interfere with their everyday life. Continuing on the subject of society, these type of people will have the need to spend moeny on the drugs even if they cannot afford it. This means that they will find other ways to obtain money to get this drug, meaning they may look to a life of crime or be in debt to a loan shark.*

## The All Rounder Campaign

This campaign combines the "Party Smarter" and the "Little White Lies" campaigns to educated young teens about the dangers of peer pressure and drug related activities events such as parties, music events and festivals 

**Partying, Music events and festivals**

If a person were to be under the influence of drugs during these types of events they can be subject to potential harm. In the Drug Interaction Model, it says "Due to factors closely lined to music festivals and other entertainment events such as high temperatures, extended periods of physical acitivity, close proximity to other, and lack of access the effects the drug taken can be exacerbated". This section of the campaign aims to educate young teens on how dangerous taking drugs such as MDMA in extreme environments can be.


MDMA, or ectasy or molly is a drug that is commonly found in these types of event. The use of this drug during these types of events can cause heat strokes, hyponatremia (A salt deficiency) and serotonin toxicity.

If you're feeling confused, agitated or have an extreme headache, it is completely ok to ask a Medic for help, they will not throw you out or dial 000 because your health is their number one priority.

**Little White Lies**

This campaign aims to reduce or delay the intent to use ilicit drugs in young people. It has been shown that young people tend to be more open to trying out drugs and disregard or underestimate the risks that come from these drugs. Furthermore they also overestimate the pleasure that comes from the drug, meaning they will take more to try and get the pleassure that they were promised.

This is all caused by the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for impulse control, working memory and most importantly, decision making. During the time of the developing brain, also known as adolescence, young people are at a higher risk of peer pressure, and because they're their friends or someone whom they trust a lot, they will believe that this behaviour is normal. Additionally, young people are more worried about how they're viewed by their peers than their health, so they will go and try out the drug headfirst without a worry about what comes next.

## Why join them?

These two campaigns go hand in hand, at parties you can be introduced to drugs by peers and that can become the cause of a drug addiction. Furthermore, it is important to understand that dangers of drugs, the consequences that come afterwards and the causes of drug addiction and how to avoid such things.
